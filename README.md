# Let's Rate Pets #
A full stack pet submission and rating web app, where users can submit their dogs, cats, snakes, lizards etc for other users to rate.

Submissions must include a photo of the pet and a short, but charming, description. All pets are rated out of 10. When rating, please keep in mind that dogs must be rated between 11 and 15 (because dogs are above perfection), cats between -10 and 0 (because they are cats...), and other type of pets between the traditional 0 and 10.

Let's Rate Pets is built with React, Node/Express, and PostgreSQL.
